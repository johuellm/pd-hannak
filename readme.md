This code is initially programmed by [Hannak et al](https://personalization.ccs.neu.edu/Projects/PriceDiscrimination/) and only adapted to work combined with the [personalization-testsuite](https://github.com/johuellm/personalization-testsuite) in order to evaluate the capabilities of this code to detect price discrimination in the e-commerce sector.

## Installation Guide

1. For the required packages either install them via the requirements.txt or by using the virtual environment which is included in this repository.
   
2. For webscraping PhantomJS needs to be installed and added to PATH on windows. For this you could follow the [How-To-Install-PhantomJS tutorial](https://testguild.com/how-to-install-phantomjs/).
